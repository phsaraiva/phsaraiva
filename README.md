### Who am I?

I also become passionated about data science in 2020 and at this moment I'm giving my first steps as an aspiring Data Scientist. In this repository you will find my Data Science projects focused on Exploratory Data Analysis. At this moment, all of them were developed using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
